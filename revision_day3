python revision day 3:


\n use for next line

example:
s="chennai\nmadhurai"
print(s)

output:
chennai
madhuari

how to get \n in output?
just add r before the string value
r stands for raw data

basic string methods:

name="tamilnadu"
print(name.upper())

output:
TAMILNADU

name="TAMILNADU"
print(name.lower())
output:
tamilnadu

news="today school holiday"
print(name.title())
output:
Today School Holiday

notes:title method change each word first letter into capital

finiding first and last letter of a string :

word="hello how are you"

print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[-1])
print(word[len(word)-1])
output:
h
e
u
u

notes:
len() function used for calculate a string length.
string index start from 0 so we can find a last letter of a string by substract length of a string -1 and using string[-1].
last letter of a string index is -1
we can use a bool value in index,because true and false value is 1 and 0.

slice operator:

word="welcome"
print(word[0:5])
print(word[2:6])
print(word[:6])
print(word[2:])
print(word[:])
print(word[-1:])

output:
welco
lcom
welcome
lcome
welcome
e

notes:
here 0 stands for starting index and 5 stands for index no 4 so the output is welco
we not mention a value before the collan it's means starting index ,if we not mention a value after collan it's means last index of a string.if we mention only a collan it's gives the full string in output.
we cannot use a reverse slicing.

step operator:

word="tamilnadu"
print(word[::2])
print(word[::3])

output:
tmlau
tia
notes:
starts from begin index and step by 2.

capitalize a particular string index using slice operator:

word=tamilnadu
print(word[2].upper())
print(word[:2]+word[2].upper()+word[3:])
output:
M
taMilnadu

notes:
in this program + act as concodenation operater.concodenation operator add a string valus.
